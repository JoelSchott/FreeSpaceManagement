# Implementation
## Memory Space
All functions related to the memory space still need to be implemented. There is documentation in the header file, which should be sufficient if used in conjunction with
the implementation of the experiment in experiment.cpp.
## Algorithms
Worst Fit, First Fit, and Next Fit still need to be implemented. There is some documentation in the header file, and the example of Best Fit should be sufficient.
## Main
There should be a file to run trials of experiments across ranges of parameter values, outputing the results. This can be main.cpp, and what is currently main.cpp can be converted to a testing file.
# Testing
Some sort of testing framework needs to be added. Everything still needs to be tested, although Best Fit has passed informal unit tests (main.cpp).  
There should be tests for process creation, algorithms, memory space, and the experiment.
# Experiment
The experiment needs to be performed with a number of trials and all of the data needs to collected and analyzed.
# Write Up
We should have a document with a formal description of the problem, hypothesis, methods, results, and conclusions.
We should also make a presentation (slides) of the information.
